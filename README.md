# DCS_design

Design oligos for comprehensive double-mutation libraries. Oligos contain mixed bases that can be ordered from some vendors (IDT oPools) but not others. Requires a .fasta containing the sequence to be mutagenized, and a .txt where each line is an orthogonal primer that will be used to demultiplex the pool. By default, SapI leaders and tails are added for the GoldenGate assembly, but these are configurable.
